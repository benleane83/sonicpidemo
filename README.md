# Sonic Pi Demos

This repo contains a collection of Sonic Pi demos and songs created by me using GitHub Copilot.

[Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/) is an amazing live music coding application created to help people learn to code in new ways. It was created by Sam Aaron and now runs on multiple OSes/devices, and now supports a [Sonic Pi VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=s00500.sonic-pi-extension). This allows you to write and play Sonic Pi scripts directly in VS Code, using GitHub Copilot at your side.
